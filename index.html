  <h1>Malik Gary Timeline</h1>
  <h2>Provided by: Shelly Battista</h2>
    <h3>July 23, 2020<h3>
    <p>Received a text from L. Ensley, <a href="nbc">link to NBC12 report on the shooting (7/7/2020)</a> stating a fifth person was arrested. Both of us agreed this was not in keeping with what we know of these two men. Malik and Thai-kee Dunn are both former students. They would never be involved in something like this.
    <h3>September 2, 2020</h3>
    <p>Phone call with Malik. (15 minutes) I found out they all signed a declaration back in July they did not need/want a lawyer present during questioning. Identifying Thai-Kee Dunn as the one most likely to break, they pushed this fragile young man to the brink, crying, then got his mother on the phone at which point she stated to the interrogators Thai-Kee would say that Malik had a gun in the truck.
	     Malik relayed this story to me. They were seated together during a court proceeding and Thai-Kee told Malik what had transpired. Thai-Kee was upset, he had been heavily pressured into saying something he knew was not true. All other statements from the occupants of the truck that night denied Malik had a gun.
	     Per the gun owner, the gun they initially suspected as the murder weapon was allegedly stolen by Malik in March. Malik had been living in Kentucky with his Grandmother helping her out. He was not in Richmond in March. The gun owner then changed his story and said he lost it. Turns out the owner of the gun was a different individual, not the suspect they had questioned.</p>
    <h3>September 5, 2020</h3>
    <p>Text/call with W. Baker, friend of Malik (also former student, stationed in Europe at that time)</p>
    <h3>September 16, 2020</h3>
    <p>Spoke to Malik briefly, (9 minutes) call dropped while traveling.</p>
    <h3>September 21, 2020</h3>
    <p>Spoke to Mr. Goots (Public Defender for Malik) the first time. I was taken aback when he stated “one of those four” had to have shot the victim. Odd, because five were arrested, not four. I also felt odd that he did not address innocence, only guilt.
	     Later this same day, I received information that a transgender female, Harmony, was the likely shooter. I sent a social media page to Mr. Goots referencing the gang hit and a video (made days later, posted by Harmony herself) of Harmony waving the gun around. He later said the prosecution already had this information. This avenue has not been pursued.</p>
    <h3>September 26, 2020</h3>
    <p>Contact with W. Baker, confirmed additional character
      reference for Malik. Confirmed I had not heard back
      from Mr. Goots about the discovery.</p>
    <h3>December 7, 2020</h3>
    <p>left another message for Mr. Goots. Expected Malik to be
      out on bail on the 15th. (Bail was denied.)</p>
    <h3>May 2, 2021</h3>
    <p>Spoke to Malik and W. Baker, conference call. Received another name for character reference. Trial is May 4th, Malik is concerned since Mr. Goots showed up saying let’s get ready for a trial and had Malik list the questions to ask of the witnesses. In the months prior to trial, Mr. Goots visited Malik five times or so, always to discuss a plea. It was clear the public defender did not wish to be involved in a trial and was not acting in the client’s best interest. The discovery information I had at the time indicated a very weak case, easily won.
	  Contact with Ms. Golt, teacher, confirmed she would supply
    character reference for Malik.</p>
    <h3>May 3, 2021</h3> <p>LM for Mr. Goots.</p>
    <h3>May 4, 2021</h3>
    <p>Since I was not contacted by Mr. Goots to confirm time and courtroom, I found the location myself and waited outside the courtroom with Malik’s family and friends. Prosecution entered and exited the courtroom, but no word from Mr. Goots. There was no communication at all between the PD and Malik’s family and friends. When it abruptly ended, it was the bailiff who informed us Malik had pled no contest after several strong conversations with his PD. Mr. Goots had already exited the building without communicating anything to the family and
    friends of his client, sitting in the hallway directly
    to the right as he left the courtroom.</p>
    <h3>May 5, 2021</h3>
    <p>Mr. Goots called me about appearing at sentencing on September 15th. I voiced my displeasure at the outcome of the “trial” and mentioned we were pursuing outside counsel to withdraw the plea and request a new trial date. Mr. Goots stated how much work he does for his clients without much financial return and invited me to talk to people about his work ethics. (See note on September 6, 2021) He also indicated we’d need to pay someone to get the work done (e.g. withdraw the plea) once again indicating he was not willing to follow his client’s
    wishes. I verified my contact information and we ended the
    conversation.</p>
    <h3>May 11, 2021</h3>
    <p>Contact with JV Russell, Malik’s aunt, advised her of a
      meeting I had with a private lawyer on the 12th.</p>
    <h3>May 12, 2021</h3>
    <p>Spoke to Mr. Cravens, attorney. He looked into some of
      the evidence I printed up from my phone (difficult to see
      some of it.) He was honest, forthright, admitted there were
      possible holes in the case, but PDs are not likely to put
      forth a lot of effort without being paid for their work.
      He indicated he was going to check with a Black lawyer
      he knew who had just won a similar case and have him
      contact me, if he was willing to take a look at the
      information.</p>
    <h3>August 19, 2021</h3>
    <p>I drove to the New Kent facility to pick up the Malik’s
      copy of the discovery, arranged ahead of time with August
      19th as the pick up date. Mrs. Terry was helpful and found
      the request slip, but the packet was not there, no one
      knew where it was. Mrs. Terry took my info and said she
      would call me.</p>
    <h3>August 20, 2021</h3>
    <p>LM for Mr. Goots. (took six minutes, voice mail inoperative)
	  Mrs. Terry called back, they would check with the sergeant
    who had taken the packet, but he was not in, might be in on
    Monday. I thanked her for her help in getting this. Malik had
    started the process about three weeks ago, filling out
    paperwork for different procedural avenues in order for me
    to pick it up.</p>
    <h3>August 23, 2021</h3>
    <p>Mrs. Terry called, the discovery packet was with Malik’s
      property, which was still in Henrico for some reason.
      I thanked her for her help.</p>
    <h3>August 22, 2021</h3>
    <p>I arrived at the Henrico facility, only to find out
      the property pickup closed at 3:30, earlier than the
      4:30 time for the sheriff office.</p>
    <h3>August 23, 2021</h3>
    <p>I picked up the discovery packet at Henrico. They had
      to search for it, only took a few minutes.</p>
    <h3>September 1/2, 2021</h3>
    <p>Mr. Goots called to get additional information on names and addresses in order to send subpoenas for the sentencing date as he already had mine on file. I advised him I would get information and contact him as soon as possible. In my opinion, it seemed to be rather late to gather this information. I had assumed he had all the contact information already since he had supposedly prepared for a trial in May and should have requested all those witnesses for the May trial date.
      Contact with Ms. Golt. Advised her of the situation, will try and get a letter to me before September 15th.
      Contact with Ms. Ensley. Advised her she could email a letter to me and I would see it gets there.
      Contact Dr. Bell, principal Armstrong High School. He is arranging as many
      letters as possible from people who knew Malik.</p>
    <h3>September 2, 2021</h3>
    <p>I emailed Mr. Goots, advising him I had contacted multiple people willing to write letters, but as they are educators and school staffing is impossibly short with no subs, they were unable to physically appear at this time. He was not happy and attempted to blame me for not having the information he needed. He indicated we had spoken weeks ago about this, and I said yes, we had. I told him I assumed at this point he had everything he needed and to be following up at this late date was certainly not in Malik’s best interest. (See attached emails.)</p>
    <h3>September 6, 2021</h3>
    <p>While researching Mr. Goots and his practice, I noticed a
      Google review from May of 2021, and tracked down the
      author of the review. With the author’s permission,
      I have attached a copy of his review, which seems to
      resemble many similar issues <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MNQcMvX1zrEEiWR27" target="_blank"><strong>Mr. Gary</strong></a> has had with Mr.
      Goots. Lack of communication, lack of preparedness, acting against the client’s wishes. New counsel should be requested, the plea should be withdrawn, and a new trial date set.</p>
    <h3>September 6, 2021</h3>
  <p>Completed another review of the discovery, making notes on questions which need answered.
	   The bullet trajectory went through the back of the head on a slightly upward angle, indicating the shooter might be of similar or shorter height than the victim, (69”) if the victim was standing when shot. Mr. Gary is at least six inches or more taller, and if the victim was standing, it’s likely the trajectory would have been on a slightly downward path had a taller suspect been involved.
	   They have no information as to where the shooting occurred due to the lack of witnesses. on the doorstep, in the parking lot, by a car, on the grass strip. Several blood spatters in places. No bullet from this one wound was recovered.
	   The gun found in the car was removed from evidence since none of the bullets matched.
	    What potential scenarios have been run to determine the most likely positions of victim and shooter at the time of the shooting?
	No facial bruising or contusions noted in the autopsy,
  indicating the victim had not likely been pushed or thrown onto
  the ground, the one shot would have likely killed him instantly,
  dropping him at that point. Scenarios need to be run as to what
  happened since the prosecution has no idea where anyone was
  during the entire incident.</p>
  <h3>September 11, 2021</h3>
  <p>Found another person online who reviewed Mr. Goots as a one star. Reached out to her, waiting for any response.
	Discovered Supreme Court Ruling, McCoy vs Louisiana, 2018. Defense counsel must follow the client’s wishes in maintaining innocence despite any penalty in play (including the death penalty. On May 4th, Malik repeatedly turned down Mr. Goots strong requests (multiple) to agree to a plea asking for what has always been the plan, a jury trial. Malik’s 6th Amendment rights were violated by counsel not following his client's wishes for a jury trial.</p>
  <h3>September 13, 2021</h3>
  <p>Malik spoke to Mr. Goots yesterday. Mr. Goots indicated I had not provided my address for him to issue a subpoena, which is incorrect. I confirmed the address he had on file was correct, on September 1.
	I later received a message from Lee/Will that Mr. Goots had
  issued a subpoena for me on September 10. I have not received
  it as of 9/13/2021, 5:59 PM.</p1>
  <h3>September 25, 2021</h3>
  <p>Malik tells me the night of the shooting, social media
    blew up (his words) with news of a drive-by shooting
    from a car, a Nissan? When the group of young men were
    first questioned, it was assumed they were the occupants
    of the car. How did the investigators go from evidence
    of a drive by shooting from a car to an individual who
    walked to a residence?</p>
